> Neomorphism Design Framework Open Source

## Features

- Neomorphism design is a design language that makes the distinction between objects and backgrounds only shadowed, giving them a voluminous and vivid feeling of life.
- The distinction between objects and backgrounds is distinguished only by shadows and light, not by color tea, giving a round and smooth impression. Overall, the UI is lively, and this is tactile beyond simple graphics.
